# Daily ARC-AGI puzzles on BlueSky

[@dailyarcagi.bluesky.bot](https://bsky.app/profile/dailyarcagi.bluesky.bot) is a bot that publishes every day the current daily ARC-AGI puzzle on Bluesky. 

ARC-AGI is a benchmark designed to be easy for humans, but very hard for AI. It presents different examples of a task (an input grid and an ouput grid) and asks the subject to understand the logic and reasoning to be able to solve a new input grid.

This bot uses the official [ARC-AGI-2 dataset](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-2) and recovers the daily puzzle from the [ARC Prize website](https://arcprize.org/). It runs using Github Actions.

This bot has been developed by [Aur√©lien Genin](https://github.com/AstroAure), with the authorization of the [ARC Prize team](https://arcprize.org/).
